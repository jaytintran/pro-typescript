# My TypeScript Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my TypeScript learning repository! Here, I document everything I’ve learned while exploring TypeScript. This serves as my personal space to practice, experiment, and refine my TypeScript skills.

## 📌 What I've Learned

Through this journey, I’ve developed a solid understanding of TypeScript, covering:

- **Core Foundations**: Type annotations, type inference, and strict typing.
- **Functions & Objects**: Function parameter annotations, return types, optional properties, and readonly properties.
- **Advanced Types**: Type aliases, unions, intersections, generics, and type narrowing.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, tuples, enums, and multi-dimensional arrays.
- **OOP in TypeScript**: Classes, interfaces, and object-oriented programming concepts.
- **Working with APIs**: Using TypeScript with Axios and Express.
- **Best Practices**: Writing clean, scalable, and efficient TypeScript code.
